## Introduction

Behaviour analysis plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion on social media platforms. This project leverages state-of-the-art transformer models, specifically BERT and XLNet, to achieve superior behaviour analysis on Twitter data. The goal is to outperform traditional supervised methods and elevate the industry standard Behaviour classification accuracy.
