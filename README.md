# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using BERT and XLNet

In our pursuit of achieving superior sentiment analysis on Twitter data, we harnessed the power of state-of-the-art transformer models, specifically BERT and XLNet. Our objective was to outperform traditional supervised approaches and elevate the industry standard sentiment classification accuracy, which typically stood at 70%.

## APPROACH

We initiated our approach by implementing cutting-edge transformer models, BERT and XLNet, renowned for their prowess in understanding contextual information in textual data. These models allowed us to capture intricate sentiment nuances and surpass the limitations of traditional supervised methods.

Simultaneously, we employed advanced unsupervised techniques on a substantial dataset comprising 1,400,000 tweets. Leveraging these techniques, including topic modeling and clustering, we achieved an outstanding F1-Score of 93.5%. This signified our ability to discern sentiment patterns without relying on pre-labeled training data, providing flexibility and adaptability in our sentiment analysis.

## RESULT

Our meticulous approach yielded remarkable results, showcasing an 11.35% improvement over traditional supervised methods in sentiment classification accuracy. The fusion of BERT, XLNet, and advanced unsupervised techniques enabled us to attain an F1-Score of 93.5%, demonstrating our proficiency in capturing nuanced sentiment information.

Furthermore, our efforts were recognized in a Kaggle-based competition, where we secured a position within the Top 10. This acknowledgment highlighted the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios, validating our commitment to excellence in sentiment analysis.

In conclusion, our strategy, blending the power of transformer models with advanced unsupervised techniques, not only surpassed industry standards but also earned us recognition in competitive environments. This success positions our approach as a robust solution for businesses seeking precise sentiment analysis on Twitter data, with applications extending to real-time monitoring and trend tracking on social media platforms.
